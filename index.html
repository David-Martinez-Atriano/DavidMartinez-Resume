        <div class="subheading mb-5">AccountantðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is David Martinez, and I am a first generation Chicano college student who aims to become a professional accountant with my own successful accounting firm and be a volunteer counselor for any place that needs such a service when I am retired. I enjoy working with other people and can adjust to work in the way others can, but I can work just as well alone. I love working with numbers and learning about new things regardless of how difficult they may be. Even when things get tough, I always try my best to catch on, keep my head up, and motivate others to keep moving forward as well! <br><br>

        I have had a keen eye in being able to spot opportunities that could be useful for either myself or my peers and finding the bright side of anything that happens. When it came to 8th grade, I wanted to take easier route for high school, mainly because most of my friends at the time would be going to our local high school. But after I was put into a college preparatory high school a city over because of my parents, I had to go along with it and I could not fight back against it. So I figured that now that I was there, I should make the most of it and see it as an opportunity to grow my network and explore new things. And that is exactly what I did. I learned many things from everyone at that school, and I would not be where I am now without my high school and everything it offered to me. I learned a lot about personal professional development. I was exposed to so much content and lessons about the outside world and what might be some things I could do for the future. I learned how to have fun with friends and peers from different grades in extracurricular activities and clubs. <br><br>

        I am the person I am now because of many, many events and opportunities that I was presented, and I learned to take advantage of those opportunities and make the best out of them.
